How does LLMs work? 
- Text Generation process
   -- Supervised Learning
      - Get Labeled data ---> Train the AI model ----> Predict the next word
   - A language model is built using supervised learning to repeatedly predict the next word (token)
- Two major types of LLM
  - Base LLM
    Predicts next word, based on text training data
    
  - Instruction Tuned LLM
